Roman Numeral Converter üèõÔ∏è
This project is one of my capstone projects from FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript curriculum. It demonstrates the application of fundamental JavaScript concepts by creating a Roman numeral converter that allows users to input a number and see its Roman numeral equivalent.

What I Learned
1. Algorithm Development:
Structured the logic for converting numbers to Roman numerals using mappings, loops, and subtraction.

Broke down a complex problem into manageable steps, improving my problem-solving skills.

2. Input Validation:
Ensured the program handles edge cases like invalid inputs, numbers less than 1, and numbers greater than 3999.

3. Event-Driven Programming:
Gained experience with click and keydown events to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

4. DOM Manipulation:
Dynamically updated the webpage by selecting and modifying elements using JavaScript.

5. Reusable Code:
Created modular and reusable functions, such as convertToRoman, to keep the code clean and easy to maintain.

6. Debugging Skills:
Used the browser console and debugging techniques to test the application and fix issues effectively.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the interface.

CSS: (Optional styling for enhancing visuals).

JavaScript: For building the logic and adding interactivity.

How It Works
User Input:

Enter a number between 1 and 3999 in the input field.

The app validates the input and converts it to a Roman numeral.

Conversion:

The conversion logic is based on predefined Roman numeral mappings.

Interactive Features:

Click the "Convert" button or press the "Enter" key to trigger the conversion.

Result Display:

The converted Roman numeral appears dynamically on the webpage.
